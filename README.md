## Description

This project prompts the user to make a choice on what it wants the application to do. Once a choice is selected, they are either given a table of data or prompted to input information to add data.

For this project, I used schema.sql in the db folder to set up my data tables. I also included a seeds.sql to have starter data.

I used inquirer and mysql to make this program work.

I am still working on fixing the last function and changing my code to make it simpler (like using map).
